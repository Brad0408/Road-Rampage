# Road Rampage
 
Found my first game I ever made for a sixth form project.
This game was made in with python, pygame and idle for its IDE.
As such I have no idea how I would be able to compile this on visual studio, but at least all the code and files are still here.

I also have an old recording of gameplay which can be view here - https://youtu.be/OdVi3iZFPhA
