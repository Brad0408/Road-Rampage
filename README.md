# Road Rampage
 
Found my first game I ever made for a sixth form project.

This game was made in with python, pygame and idle for its IDE.

As such I have no idea how I would be able to compile this on visual studio, but at least all the code and files are still here.

For Code - ([Main Game.py](https://github.com/Brad0408/Road-Rampage/blob/main/Main%20Game.py) has all the code for this game)


<ins> I also have an old recording of gameplay which can be view here ! - </ins>
